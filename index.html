        <p class="footerh1p">Do you Know Yoda Speak? Yoda often orders sentences as Object-Subject-Verb,
             split verbs, switches entire phrases and sometimes uses sentences that are different from his 
             normal syntax! Because of this it is difficult to accurately represent his sentence structure. 
             But we tried hard and we constantly improve our patterns. Have fun and may the force be with you!
